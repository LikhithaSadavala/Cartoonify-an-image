# Cartoonify-an-image

To convert an image to a cartoon, multiple transformations are done. Firstly, an image is converted to a Grayscale image. Then, the Grayscale image is smoothened, and we try to extract the edges in the image. Finally, we form a color image and mask it with edges. This creates a beautiful cartoon image with edges and lightened color of the original image.
